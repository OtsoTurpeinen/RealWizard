Proof of concept Spell system (mod for Dota 2).

 Idea is to let players learn complex procedural spell system.

System contains 30 spell effects (that can becombined in different ways) and 6 different delivery methods (missile, trap, etc.)
It combines delivery methods, spell effects and bunch of parameters (disance, aoe, powers, durations) to create system where player can find 5 832 000 000 (30^3 * 6 * 4 * 6 * 15 * 5 * 5 * 4) different spells (though some are just minor power level changes).
